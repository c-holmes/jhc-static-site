        <h1>Visual Offerings</h1>
        <p>
          Whether you present at conferences or webinars or facilitate group
          process, you can add value by including a graphic visual or ‘map’ to
          your message or event. A visual ‘map’ or sketchnote will enhance the
          experience either ‘in the moment’ during the Zoom call or after an
          event.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let’s explore how others have used visual offerings to increase their
          impact. Click on the buttons below to see some examples.

              Rebecca Sutherns offered a webinar of tips and advice to improve

              This image represents Michael Bungay Stanier’s key messages from a
              video for his new book, The Advice Trap. This map was 1 of 5
              created to support his video series. He sent these maps as part of
              a follow-up email to the 2,000 video subscribers.

              I captured Jackie Lauer’s key messages on Resiliency from her
              presentation in a Zoom call. She provided this map to all
              participants as a take-away. The map also serves as a ‘business

              Nancy Priest presented to learning professionals and this

        <h3>Maps supporting you as a Facilitator</h3>
        <p>
          As a facilitator, you want graphic recording to support the group
          process and outcome - whether virtual or in person. A map summarizes
          key points, highlights of break-out group reports and decisions
          towards next steps. I would work closely with you as you plan the
          agenda to support the group moving forward.

              Highlights of this All Staff Meeting were captured on this one
              map. Includes key content from the morning training session and
              the highlights of the afternoon facilitated break-out group
              activity – report-backs of how to demonstrate the newly launched
              concepts in daily work.

              A map of this group’s first Zoom meeting included highlights of

        <h3>Maps supporting you as a Leader</h3>
        <p>
          As a leader of a team or organization, you want to capture the
          attention of current and potential stakeholders, employees and clients
          by engaging them in the big picture of your strategy and/or services.
          An overview map can attract their interest and consideration of your
          story.

            <p>
              This was my first digital map of an organization’s strategic plan,
              targeted to engage employees. Carizon laminated a map for every
              employee with highlights of each of the 4 Strategic Initiatives on
              the back. Managers and employees discussed the link of their
              specific work connected to the strategic initiatives.

          transfer of learning and reinforcement. Consider whimsical graphics to
          supplement your presentation within the session.

              learnings. Wonderful ‘transfer of learning’ practice.
